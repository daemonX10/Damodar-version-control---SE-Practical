In software development, SCM refers to tools and processes used to track and manage changes to code. It's vital for collaboration and version control. Examples include:

- Git: A distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously.
- SVN: A centralized version control system that tracks changes to files and directories over time.

GitHub is a platform that hosts Git repositories, so using GitHub for SCM means you're using Git to manage code versions, and GitHub as the place to store, share, and collaborate on that code.

üõ†Ô∏è What Can You Do?
1. Version Control
Track every change made to your code over time:

See who changed what and when

Revert back to previous versions if needed

Create different branches for features or experiments

2. Branching and Merging
You can:

Create branches for new features or bug fixes

Work on them independently

Merge them back into the main codebase (often via pull requests)

3. Collaboration with Pull Requests
A pull request (PR) is how developers propose changes:

Others can review the code

Add comments, suggest changes, or approve it

Once ready, it gets merged into the main branch

4. Issue Tracking and Project Management
GitHub also helps with:

Issues: Report bugs or request features

Projects: Kanban-style boards to track tasks

Actions: Automate workflows like testing or deployment

üöÄ Typical Workflow
Clone the repo:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
Create a new branch:

bash
Copy
Edit
git checkout -b feature-login
Make changes and commit:

bash
Copy
Edit
git add .
git commit -m "Add login feature"
Push your branch:

bash
Copy
Edit
git push origin feature-login
Open a pull request on GitHub

After review, merge the branch into main or develop
